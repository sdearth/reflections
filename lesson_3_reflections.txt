When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When you're collaborating with other developers. 
When you don't want to have a redundant backup system.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because you may not be ready to receive and adopt changes. You may be in the middle of a refactor and not able to merge yet.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

A branch is a set of commits that have diverged from other sets of commits - the commits are reachable only from the head of the branch.

A clone is a copy of a remote repository. 

A fork is a "special" clone created by Github that's just a copy of someone else's repository under your account, and tracked as a copy to maintain ownership paths.
